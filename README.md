Algorithm implementation 

Interesting algorithms or interesting implementations of algorithms

Dynamic programming (very basic) / Recursion
- longest_subsequence.py
- making_change.py 
- subset.py
- super_digit.py
- unique_paths.py (similar to chess_board.c!) + unique_paths2.py
- chess_board.c

Efficiency tests
- bin_search.py
- prime.py
- zero_knowledge.py

Leetcode
- bin_tree_tilt.py
- string_bin_tree.py
- unique_paths2.py
- nQueens.py

Famous algorithms: Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP.c)

Notable ones: fib.c, chess_board.c, permutations (normal and better), sum_3.py, unique_paths.py + unique_paths2.py, nQueens.py

Rarely included external libs so this below will be fine.

To compile any of the C programs: gcc -o X X.c
To execute python scripts: chmod 755 X.py --> ./X.py
