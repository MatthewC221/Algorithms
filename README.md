Algorithm implementation 

Interesting algorithms or interesting implementations of algorithms

Dynamic programming (very basic) / Recursion
- longest_subsequence.py
- making_change.py 
- subset.py
- super_digit.py

Efficiency tests
- bin_search.py
- prime.py

Notable ones: fib.c, chess_board.c, permutations (normal and better), sum_3.py
